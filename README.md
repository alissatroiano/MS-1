# Milestone 1

This responsive, user-friendly website was created for Infinity, a fictional yoga and meditation studio in New York, New York. As the Milestone 1 Project for [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net) Full Stack Software Development Program, this website was built with HTML, CSS & Bootstrap.

The website features an attractive jumbotron image with a schedule button that, when clicked, directs the user to the class schedule section of the webpage. The schedule section provides new & existing members with class details, times and an option to signup. Infinity’s website also includes an aesthetically appealing 'About' section to provide information for those who wish to know more about the studio and its approach as well as user stories (or 'Quotes'), which are a popular trust element in UX. 

## UX

This website was built for a fictional yoga and meditation studio in Manhattan. The goal of the studio is to attract new members & retain their existing client base. The target market for this website is men & women (ages 4-36) who live in New York, NY and currently practice or wish to begin practicing yoga and meditation.

After much research, planning and strategizing, it was determined that the final version of this website was the best way to help Infinity studio achieve their goals for the following reasons:

* The website is responsive across all devices, an essential factor for a target market of young men and women (24-36 year olds) living in an urban area, like NYC.

* Navigation is intuitive across all devices.

* The website is responsive; dynamic changes are made to its' appearance, depending on device screen size and orientation.

* The website places class details, class times and class sign up forms in one central location, so users will not have to click a lot, making them more likely to sign up.

* The website includes an 'About' section that fulfills one of the client's goals: to provde users with information about the studio and its' procedures.

User stories were created by the developer during the planning phase of this project and were used to help guide the wire framing process:

> As a user, I can navigate the page easily, so I don't get frustrated or confused.
>>
> As a user, I can click a link and move to a different section of the page, so I don't have to scroll around looking for content.
>>
> As a user, I can tell that I am on a yoga website immediately, so I do not get confused.
>>
> As a user, I can navigate back to the top of the page easily, so I don't have to spend time scrolling up!
>>
> As a user, I can comlplete the 'Sign Up' process in less than 3 clicks!

Quotes included in the final build of Infinity:

Quote 1
> Infinity is the best place to strengthen your yoga practice. The instructors are dedicated, patient & thorough!
>
> ***Octavia Bliss***

Quote 2
> When I first joined I was worried that I wasn't flexibile, but Infinity's staff taught me that anybody can do yoga!
>
> ***Daniel Zen***

Quote 3
> Infinity's classes taught me the tools needed to deal with day-to-day stress & anxiety. Now I'm happier than ever!
>
> ***Sara Solar***
