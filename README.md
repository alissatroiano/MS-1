# Milestone 1

This responsive website was created for Infinity, a fictional Yoga & Meditation studio in New York, New York. As the Milestone 1 Project for [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net) Full Stack Software Development Program, this website was built with HTML, CSS & Bootstrap.

Infinity’s website addresses all of the studio's goals in a clean, user-friendly, and visually appealing manner. The website's Jumbotron includes a call-to-action button that directs users to the schedule section where class details, times, and a signup button can be accessed with ease. The website also includes an interactive, 'About' section, relatable 'Customer Reviews, and contact details.

## UX

The goal of Infinity's website is to attract new & existing members to the studio by providing class details and information about the studio and its procedures. The target market for Infinity is men & women (ages 24-36) who live in New York, NY, currently practice or wish to begin practicing yoga and meditation.

The final version of this website allows Infinity to achieve its' goals for the following reasons:

* The website provides a call-to-action button with a link in the Jumbotron (above the fold).

* The website provides class details and class times in one central location.

* The website provides information about the studio and its' procedures.

* Infinity's website is responsive.

* The website navigation is intuitive.

Customer Reviews were created by the [developer](https://www.github.com/alissatroiano) during the planning phase of this project and were used to help guide the wireframing process:

> As a potential studio member, I want the ‘About’ section to provide meaningful information so I can decide if it's the right place for me to sign up.
>>
> As a prospective Infinity member, I want to be able to contact the studio directly so I can inquire about new memberships.  
>>
> As a potential Infinity member, I want to be able to view the website from my mobile device so I can check it out while I'm on the go.
>>
> As an Infinity member, I can view the class schedule so I can plan my yoga & meditation routine accordingly.
>>
> As a studio member, I can read about all of Infinity's classes so I can decide if I want to try something new.
>>
> As an Infinity member, I can view the studio's contact information so I can inquire about my membership or any other issues.

To determine what features were the most important and most viable, the following Strategy Plane activity was completed during the planning phase of this project.

![Trade Off Chart](wireframes//tradeoffchart.png)

A full write-up of the strategic planning conducted for this project can also be viewed [here](wireframes//ms1planning.pdf). To only view charts and tables, check out [this document](wireframes//strategyplane.pdf).

Once the strategy exercises were completed, the following low-fidelity wireframes were created by the [developer](https://www.github.com/alissatroiano).

* [Desktop Wireframe](wireframes//desktopwireframe.jpeg)

* [Tablet Wireframe](wireframes//tabletwireframe.png)

* [Mobile Wireframe](wireframes//mobilewireframe.png)

After starting the project and getting a better feel for the desired outcome, the developer made the second round of more detailed, high-fidelity wireframes.

These wireframes guided the remainder of the development process.

### UX Design

#### Typography

The fonts selected for Infinity's website were:

1. Playfair Display, serif
2. Futura PT, sans-serif

The developer selected these fonts because:

* When it comes to typography, serif and sans-serif fonts pair together nicely, creating a modern and clean aesthetic that will appear to the project's target market.

* Playfair Display: A serif font that brings both style & elegance to the project.

* Futura-PT: is a modern, sans-serif font that is clean, visually appealing, and easy for users to read.

#### Color Scheme

The following color scheme was chosen for this project.

![Color Palette](wireframes//colorpalette.png)

The developer chose this color palette after much research and consideration for several reasons.

* The color (#69A8A9) is a mix of blue and green, which are both associated with positive, calm emotions, like comfort and happiness, according to UXD Research from many sources.

![Toptal color psychology](wireframes//colortheory1.png)

* Certain shades of blue/green (like #69A8A9) are strongly associated with environmentalism and nature, which makes this color perfect for Infinity's website.

* Blue is the most universally liked color in the world (for both men and women).

* Shades of white and gray (like #F2F2F2) are popular among minimalist designs, which is exactly what I was going for when building Infinity.

* The dark blue (#081126) in the color palette was chosen because it adds contrast to the page. It is also a dark shade of classic blue, which was chosen as the [Pantone](https://www.pantone.com/color-intelligence/color-of-the-year/color-of-the-year-2020-tools-for-designers) color of the year for 2020.
